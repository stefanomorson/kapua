  @setup
  Scenario: Setup test resources
    Given Init Security Context
    And Start Docker environment with resources

  Scenario: Container Start

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    And Device birth message is sent
    And Device "rpione3" is connected within 10s
    And I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And I add device targets to job
      | rpione3 |
    And I search for step definition with the name
      | Container Start |
    And I add job step to job with name "Test Step - Container Start" and with selected job step definition and properties
      | name     | type              | value |

  Scenario: Image Delete

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    And Device birth message is sent
